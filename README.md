# TESTTASK-POKEMON.

This application is as a project on a summer internship from the university, after which - can be applied for an internship program (if, of course, the project and my knowledge to date like).
I would like to enroll in the internship program, where there will be the necessary guys who will be able to share their experiences and help me develop in this direction.
